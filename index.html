             This is just one example of an abandoned farm in the 
             Westfjords region of Iceland. 
             Despite what you might think this farm was right on 
             the main highway.

            <br/>
            This farm, not abandoned, was far removed from any major
             city or other settlement. Many of the farms we passed were 
             pressed against the water like this, doubtless needing to 
             take advantage of the resources and access offered by the sea.
